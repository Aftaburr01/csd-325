"""Forest Fire Sim, modified by Sue Sampson, based on a program by Al Sweigart
A simulation of wildfires spreading in a forest. Press Ctrl-C to stop.

MODIFICATIONS FOR CSD-325:
1. Added WATER constant ('~') and its color (blue).
2. Added placeLake() function to create a central, permanent water feature.
3. Modified createNewForest() to call placeLake() after initial random placement.
4. Modified main() loop: Water cells are ignored and cannot be changed (firebreak).
5. Modified displayForest() to render WATER cells in blue.
